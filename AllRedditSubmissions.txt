[Here's the video from their press conference in 1997.](https://youtu.be/PpXsAoXZIMg)

Look how positive and constructive he is.  He was defending her.  She looked happy and comfortable with him.  He didn't fat shame her - he did jokingly "fat shame" himself and the reporters. 

Trump defended her and saved her from having to give up her Miss Universe crown.  He did a great thing.  How does she repay him?  By publicly attacking and slandering him. 

She said that Trump called her "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeping."  There is no proof that either of these claims are true. 

She also lied and said that Trump's actions caused her to develop an eating disorder.  This is completely untrue - an interview with the Washington Post in 1997 reveals that she had eating disorders before winning the Miss Universe Pageant. 

["I was anorexic and bulimic, but almost all of us are," Machado says without so much as a blink. "When I was preparing for Miss Universe, it was an obsession for me to not gain weight. By the time I won, I was actually recovering. But the year leading to it, I didn't eat at all."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1997/05/16/miss-universe-sizing-up-her-reign/4b76f45c-aaa9-4b44-8acf-39f2d4af7598/)

I'm glad this story has come to light.  It has improved my opinion of Trump for the great thing he did for Machado.  He could have simply terminated her, but he did not.  He defended her and saved her from losing her crown.

As for Alicia Machado, my opinion of her is that she is a despicable person who is attacking and slandering a man who did a great deal for her.  Shame on you Ms. Machado.

Summary of the facts:

1. Trump defended Alicia Machado in 1997 and saved her from having to give up her Miss Universe crown
2. Trump was positive and constructive in the press conference, and defended (not fat shamed) Machado, who looked happy and comfortable with him
3. Alicia Machado has said that Trump called her "Miss Piggy" and "Miss Housekeeping," but there is no proof that either of these claims are true
4. Alicia Machado said Trump caused her to develop eating disorders - this is a lie, as she had eating disorders before she was Miss Universe</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

No one's out of shape (save for Scotty in the movies, but whatever he'd put in his time), everyone's beautiful, everyone involves themselves in art, and everyone is pretty much above what we would call an average education level.

This is, of course, because it's Gene Roddenberry's idea of a perfect human civilization. Humans for the most part have abandoned the things that hold us back, and in doing so embrace becoming well-rounded Renaissance Men (and Women).

So it'd make sense that there are "minimum requirements" for some things, similar to how in today's university system there are usually minimum requirements for art, history, and literature even if you're studying science. Everyone is introduced to stage presence and drama, but those who are career-oriented only dipped their toes into it, so they walked away with some love for drama but didn't develop good acting chops. **This explains any hammy overacting in the show.**

The holodeck? Yeah that's basically a LARPing room and portable cosplay convention. In between negotiations with hostile alien races and saving ships from falling into stars, Picard and his crew love to unwind by playing dress up.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

Peter Baelish just placed his cards on the table and had the rug pulled out from under his feet. He gambled that Sansa's ambition would get the better of her, that she would join him in seizing control of the North on their way to the Iron Throne. But because she rejected him, because she got behind Jon as the King in the North, Baelish is going to go a different direction.

He can't go South. As he stated very clearly, he aligned with House Stark and Cersei will have heard the news. She made it clear back in Season 1 that "power is power" and she would kill him in an instant if it so suited her. Hell, she sent him to go kill the Boltons just because they had the gall to marry Sansa - no way is he turning to Cersei.

Further down south, there's the alliance between Dorne, Highgarden, some of the Ironborn, and Dany. First of all, there isn't room there for him to squeeze himself in. Secondly, Varys is with them, and no way would he let Littlefinger get his talons into that group. If Baelish's goal is the Iron Throne, supporting Dany and her crew doesn't seem like a great way of doing it.

What about the rest of the Ironborn? Well, what would Euron want with Baelish? Even if that was a budding alliance waiting to happen, Littlefinger knows that Euron is A.) more likely to offer Cersei his big cock (and probably get burned or something) B.) outnumbered and not poised to win.

So where is Littlefinger going to turn? I think he's going to look North. People have been speculating how the Night's King and the White Walkers are going to get past The Wall, and while there might well be something with Bran's arm, I think it's likely Baelish will have some sort of hand in it.

This seems ridiculous, but notice that he was in the room paying close attention when Jon was talking about the Night's King.

*"The true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."*

After Jon delivers that line there is a lot of murmuring and rabble-ing from the Northern Lords, and the camera immediately cuts to Baelish scanning them all. He, like so many others, no doubt wrote the White Walkers off as myth. But with so many people being roused by Jon, and with Jon stating openly that they are real and they're coming, the man whose house words are *Knowledge Is Power* is going to try to find out if they are real.

I think Littlefinger will find out. He'll find out, and he'll try to use it to his advantage, as is his way. Now I doubt that an "alliance" is possible, but I definitely think Littlefinger will be instrumental in the White Walkers coming South. There will be some sort of resistance set up by Jon & Friends to stop them, and at the last minute Baelish gonna Baelish and the whole thing will go to shit.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

Just having a bit of fun. Baelish is playing House Arryn. Jon & Sansa are some inheritance of House Baratheon. They marched+0 south from Castle Black with 1 footmen 1 cavalry and WunWun siege engine, Ramsay played defense+1 with 3 footmen and 2 cavalry (I guess Supply is being weird).

Baelish declares he supports+1 with 3 cavalry from Moat Cailin. Cards are thrown, House Bolton is defeated and Winterfell is taken by Jon & friends. Except...maybe in episode 10 we'll find out that that was actually a move order, and Baelish has effectively taken Winterfell.

Whatever the case, the Wildlings counter is at zero. Who knows, maybe Mustering is drawn if Jon still holds Winterfell.

EDITED - it was rightfully pointed out that no way does Jon have a star order, march+0</TEXT></SUBMISSION>
<SUBMISSION><USERNAME>OhGodDammitPope</USERNAME><POSTID>4jyd02</POSTID><TIME>2016-05-18 23:10:42</TIME><TITLE>[Everything] The Wheel - The Meereen Fighting Pit, Daenerys' Destiny, and Hizdahr's Importance</TITLE><SUBREDDIT>gameofthrones</SUBREDDIT><SCORE>32</SCORE><NUM_COMMENTS>17</NUM_COMMENTS><TEXT>Last night I rewatched Season 5 Episode 9, and during [the fighting pit scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDjs3USNBJo) I noticed some very interesting camera work, acting choices, and particular phrases that I think carry new meaning with the most recent developments in Daenerys' character.

When I first saw it last year, I took the fighting pit scene for what it was on the surface: *Dany reluctantly relents to Hizdahr zo Loraq's suggestion to open the pits, Daario is a bit of an ass toward him, Tyrion adds his two cents, oh look there's Jorah in the pit, people fight, oh shit it's a trap, Drogon shows up, Dany rides Drogon out.* It seemed pretty linear, and maybe that's on me for not watching with a very critical eye. I think perhaps I was still reeling from the weight of the previous scene (Shireen).

I then didn't really think much of it through Season 6 Episode 4. I, like some people, thought Dany seemed villainous and terrible (and not terrible in the right way, which Tyrion hoped she'd be) that she burned the Khal's alive. I mean, I don't think they should have gotten away with saying they were going to rape her to death, but I was kind of struck that she entered that tent pretty much aware that she was going to murder them. I thought it kind of unfair and shitty that she could just return to the "fire can't burn the dragon" deux ex Targaryen, and this time with a smirk on her face.

But I've come a complete 180. By watching the fighting pit scene again. **This is probably my favorite scene in this show thus far.**

Before I do a breakdown by moments, culminating at the moment where Dany embraces her true Targaryen ways, a quick rebuttal against Hizdahr zo Loraq's seemingly unimportant role in her development. I actually think that, in this deep and layered scene, he adds the final touch to the Dany that we see emerge from the flames in Season 6 Episode 4. He's actually incredibly influential, which is fair since he shares a commonality with her other enormous influence - he and Drogo were married to her.

Dany has gleaned knowledge from everyone along the way. I count myself among show-watchers who grew frustrated with her seeming lack of growth, but in reality she has added bits and pieces from all of the major characters that have come near her and played a part in her journey. Be it Viserys, Pyat Pree, Xaro Xhoan Daxos, Jorah, Daario, Grey Worm, Selmy, Missandei...as she's dealt with these people she has gradually been molded more and more into where she ends up, applying bits from each to how she should be queen. Most recently she incorporated some wisdom from Tyrion, whose main point driven home was that she tried to rule without the rich, having abolished the masters and slaves hierarchy, and it had created mass resistance and chaos.

So we would be pretty short-sighted to not believe that she learns from Hizdahr. On camera, he is mostly annoying to her. He says that she must open the fighting pits, he opposes her ways of destroying age-old customs, and he might even be leading or helping the Sons of the Harpy. It takes a bit of digging to see that he actually imparts a great deal of knowledge on her, not quite on par with her other husband, but some vital wisdom nonetheless. **Drogo** proclaimed that because of her, for her, and in her name he would take his people to the end of the world and conquer a vast kingdom, and that Dany deserved it because of what he felt for her. Hizdahr, meanwhile, opens her eyes to the truth of ruling as a Targaryen, which I'll get to.

Finally, one thing to think about when re-watching [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDjs3USNBJo) is Dany's conversation with Tyrion about [The Wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5TE6dZxLGg).



Preface from her conversation with Tyrion, the emphasis on the fact that being terrible can be a good thing in a ruler:

> D: "Why did you travel to the far side of the world to meet someone *terrible*?"

> T: "To see if you are the right kind of *terrible*."

> D: "And which kind is that?"

> T: "**The kind that prevents your people from being even moreso.**"

Now let's take a look at moments of the fighting pit scene in detail.



**"Where have you been?" "Just making sure everything is in order."**


* we are immediately suspicious of Hizdahr as he rushes in late to an event he asked for. Dany eyes him, sharing our suspicion
* it is never 100% confirmed that Hizdahr plotted the assassination attempt, and he is killed during it. Was he naive enough to think they wouldn't kill him? Was he in on it and had a change of heart later on? We'll never know.


**[An announcer opens the ceremony and introduces the first fight. It's a clear callback to The Mountain vs The Red Viper, a small and quick man fighting a behemoth to the death.**


* Hizdahr: "They're waiting for you. Clap your hands." - *she cannot be a bystander, she must cause this conflict to begin*
* Daario states confidently to bet on the smaller man, because he is like that man. Quick, agile, and smart. Daario starts acting like a bit of a prick by blatantly holding a goddamn knife to Hizdahr's throat (playfully?) and chiding the fact that Hizdahr would bet against Daario were he in the pit.
* Hizdahr: "In my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller men far more often than not." - *the camera here gives us a detailed look at Tyrion...he just experienced the death of Oberyn in a mirror of this fight, but it also speaks to Tyrion as the "smaller man", and the evils of the world as the "larger man". You could even draw a parallel to larger world pictures, like the larger army/man of Tywin ultimately defeating the smaller army/man of Robb, or Robert and Rhaegar before that. Is this part of the problem with The Wheel?*
* of course, the large man wins because the small man makes one mistake. Again, precisely what happens time and time again in Game of Thrones.


**[Tyrion states that there has been more than enough death in the world, he doesn't need it in his leisure time]**


* Hizdahr: "Fair enough. Yet, it's an unpleasant question. **But what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty.**" <- THIS!
* when Hizdahr says that line, he's in the shot, but Daenerys is in focus. Her reaction, disgust, and realization of his words is what this entire scene is fucking **about** 
* Tyrion states that just because it's always been this way doesn't mean that it's right. This is the way of the world, but is there a better way?
* Dany indicates the dead man in the ring, "That is greatness?" Hizdahr states that it is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which has been around long before their time and will be around long after
* in other words, Hizdahr is saying that people fighting and dying is **how the system works** 



> "It will remain standing long after we've returned to the dirt."

Compare this line by Hizdahr to Dany's infamous line in the prior scene with Tyrion:

> "I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel." - if the fighting pits represent how society has always behaved, Dany's breaking of that corrupt system will be shown here (and is!)



Tyrion even responds to Hizdahr's statement with "My father would've liked you." Tywin Lannister is the epitome of the corrupt ways of society - on the surface he is a powerful politician, he runs a tight ship, and he is without mercy. He ends a war "mercifully" by killing a dozen at dinner instead of thousands on the battlefield, but it is his ilk that allows everything wrong in the world to keep existing so long as it profits the ruling class.


**[We are introduced to the next fight, which is a PRETTY TRANSPARENT representation of The Wheel]**

* instead of Tyrell-Lannister-Stark-Baratheon-Targaryen, we're shown a diverse and worldly assortment of fighting men
* Dany's conversation with Hizdahr drowns out what everyone is, but we are shown a Meereenese Champion, a Dothraki, and a Westerosi knight (Jorah). We don't hear what the other fighters are, but their dress and fighting styles are varied and eclectic, so it's safe to assume that they're supposed to represent "the world"
* Emotional moment of Dany seeing Jorah, yes, but let's not let it overshadow what we're really seeing - this is the Targaryen ruler overseeing the organized war in a microcosm. This *is* Game of Thrones, right here. And as Tyrion said about The Wheel, so does it apply here...it doesn't matter who wins this round, because there will just be another round and another round, champion after champion, men dying to appease the power. This is The Wheel that Dany must break.
* Hizdahr says plainly, who is she to say that they are wrong for dying this way? *Who is she indeed?* Some of us show-watchers may be wary that this leads to megalomania, but indeed *she is the Mother of Dragons*, that's who she is, and in her mind as Hizdahr has now posed two BIG questions, Dany is finding her answer.

Now be sure to carefully watch the [second part of the fighting pit scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLeM-LSpwxc).

**[the fight happens, Jorah wins after some drama, then spears a would-be assassin before all hell breaks loose]**


What's happened here?

* Dany played by their rules. She gave the Meereenese what they wanted, opened their fighting pits, and the blood of the men that died in the pits is on her hands as she was the one to clap to begin these fights.
* The rules of the pit are savage, and she obeys them. Jorah is almost killed, Tyrion states that she could end it, and Hizdahr says she cannot. She doesn't. **Dany allows The Wheel to turn its natural course** and Jorah is saved by the timing of the Meereenese Champion stabbing his assailant in the back. Jorah did not win by prowess alone, but by the chaos of the world.
* Despite her playing the politics, marrying Hizdahr to appease the Sons of the Harpy, playing by the rules of the game, **ALLOWING THE WHEEL TO TURN** the ungrateful Sons of the Harpy attack anyway.
* They do not adhere to the rules of the pit. They are masters and slaves both, they strike from behind, there is no clap to allow them to begin attacking, they gang up and murder unwilling participants. **This is not how the game should go. This is not how The Wheel should turn**
* Hizdahr states he knows how to escape, and he is promptly stabbed to death. Her political answer is short-lived, cannibalized by those who would murder and terrorize just to oppose her.
* Dany's Unsullied army is outnumbered and ineffective. Her Westerosi knight and her Second Sons lover are outnumbered. Tyrion's diplomacy is *useless* against these people. Missandei cannot translate their way out of this. The group is surrounded, society has fallen apart, and none of Dany's tactics can save them.


**"But what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty."**

Dany closes her eyes and accepts that this cannot be survived. The Wheel spun out of control, and she will join endless rulers before her consumed by it. She cannot break the wheel with diplomats, translators, Unsullied, knights from Westeros, or the best fighting pit men that she could ever embrace.

Except there is a way out of this. She isn't any of those things. She is, however, the Mother of goddamn firebreathing Dragons.

Drogon's entrance is a cool goose bump moment as he saves the day, but it's also where the microcosm of The Wheel breaks. Drogon is something the fighting pit was never ever prepared to contain. He doesn't adhere to the rules, not because he knows them and breaks them like the Sons of the Harpy, but because he's a force of nature. He flies in and makes minced and burned meat of the people that corrupted the working system. He annihilates the problem with his fire breath and his gigantic teeth.

Dany sees him and sees the great thing that must be accomplished. The Wheel can break, though it requires killing and cruelty. But it's right there in front of her. She must be what Drogon is, willing to swoop in and burn the entire place to the ground.

She's euphoric, awe-struck by what he is capable of, but she approaches him. At first she worries because spears sink into his hide, but the spear throwers are the ones that are in true danger. They can hurt him, but he will not allow them to kill him. This is no longer her cute pet, it's no longer this cat-sized thing that would roast a piece of meat and play with her. This is her reminder of Drogo's promise, this is the stallion that will mount the world. This is everything she is supposed to be.

Do yourself a favor and [watch again from the 5:40 mark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLeM-LSpwxc). Dany pulls the spear from him and he roars out of unchecked aggression? No. Watch as though Drogon is intelligent, possibly even more intelligent than we are (according to Tyrion in S6 E2). See it as though this is Khal Drogo himself, and his roar is not a threat to Dany but rather a wake up call. He bellows a terrifying sound right into her face, and she accepts it. Without fear or hesitation, she holds her ground as he gives her a sniff and they look into each other's eyes. Drogon is telling her "This is what you are meant to do."

The scene slows down weirdly for a moment. Amidst the chaos, Dany gently reaches a hand up and caresses Drogon. A spear lands in his side and we're snapped back to the speed of reality, but she remains dazed as she climbs onto his back and flies off. In this microcosm, she's broken The Wheel. This, I really think, is a major turning point where she becomes what we saw emerge from the flames at the end of S6 E4. Until the new season I hadn't realized how she would return as queen...I was worried she'd regressed, that yet again she would be without power and have to play games to get to the top. No more games. She is brought to Vaes Dothrak and learns the rules of their games, of their Wheel, and she proceeds to instead break it. "Oh, the widows of khals live in isolation? Well too bad I'm above your games, I'll just upend the way your cruel society works."

But, of course, what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty? Daenerys toys with the khals before killing them all. She's worshiped as a god by the tribe and by her knights alike. For the first time since she freed the Unsullied, I'm extremely excited to see where her arc goes, whether she is savior or a total villain. That she will be "**the right kind of terrible...the kind that prevents her people from being even moreso.**" And it all is because I rewatched S5 E9 and the fighting pit scene. Absolutely bravo, 10/10 storytelling.

**TL;DR upon request - the Meereen Fighting Pit scene is a microcosm of the entire Game of Thrones plot, Daenerys learns here that she'll never "break the wheel" unless she embraces being "the right kind of terrible", and Hizdahr is maybe the last catalyst for this change**</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

It was turn 6 and Stark had just taken their 5th castle, and they had just won bidding on the Raven. They held Winterfell, White Harbor, Moat Cailin, the Eyrie, and Crackclaw Point. They were the only player poised to take 2 more castles and end the game so, of course, the other 3 players switched gears to counterattack and stop them.

Lannister had Harrenhal and Baratheon had King's Landing, so everybody figured on some sort of joint attack coming from there. Meanwhile, Greyjoy was tasked with "don't let him take Seaguard and Flint's Finger, pressure on Moat Cailin".

So simply put, Stark withheld the special Support order and played a couple of consolidates & raids where support would be better suited. He basically faked out, withholding a possibly game-changing order, so that he could swap it out after seeing what everybody else's orders were.

Use of the Raven to change orders isn't new. But it was cool to see the patience and willingness to **not** play one of the most helpful tokens. He even opted to leave orders off of some of the less strategic spots so that he'd be able to have the flexibility to swap the special Support in where he needed it. The support+1 ended up helping him eek out a much-needed defense of Crackclaw and he won the game.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

We were playing a standard 5 player game last night (no Martell) and I was Baratheon, & I'd given up the Iron Throne to bump Stannis. I was going last, and I'd gone all in on Fiefdoms and acquired the Sword. I had a star order as well. The other houses were all declaring going against me, but Stark was a very timid player and I was confident they weren't going to venture down from the North until they held all of it. Tyrell had just gotten screwed royally by a Wildling attack.

So it was up to Lannister and Greyjoy to pressure me, and of course Greyjoy turned on Lannister the moment she saw an opening. **That's what Greyjoy does!**

Lannister *had* been in Riverrun and Harrenhal as well as the Stony Sept, and Greyjoy had been coming around to the Mountains of the Moon in order to "put pressure" on me. They saw their chance and struck, and came in on Lannister's holds. Lannister knew they couldn't win, so they threw Tyrion and The Hound to mitigate losses before counter-attacking. Stark started to come in on Greyjoy, so Lannister went back to declaring "DON'T LEAVE BARATHEON ALONE!" and stood up his knight and footman that had retreated into Blackwater. I only had a footman in King's Landing, being supported by ships and the Kingswood, but I knew they were coming for me.

Nobody was in Crackclaw Point, so I had a move order on a knight to come into KL and I moved my footman out. To meet Lannister's knight and footman. They were unsupported.

Now, all that setup was depicting the chaos. But I thoroughly enjoyed the "over-explain your situation to plant seeds of doubt." Paraphrasing, I laid it out:

"So. It's 1 attacking 3. I have the Sword, and Stannis is a 5. So if I throw Stannis, I can end up with a 7 and I'll win no matter what. If I throw Renly and you throw *anybody but Tywin* my footman becomes a knight. In order to even hope to win this battle, you need to either throw Tywin or throw the Mountain and pray that I am bluffing."

His eyes narrowed. We chose our cards. The big reveal: Tywin against Patchface. I took The Mountain out of his deck. The night was dark and full of cursing, and without his two best cards Greyjoy and Tyrell proceeded to eat Lannister alive the next turn.

Ours is the fury.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/53vm2a/trump_opposes_president_obamas_plan_to_surrender/

Hmm. An interesting thing is going on in the comments. Every anti-Trump comment is downvoted to the bottom, while all the pro-Trump comments are at the top. 

I wonder why that could be?

A click on /u/tehdono's profile, the OP of the thread, reveals something interesting: the [exact same link](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/53vh15/trump_opposes_president_obamas_plan_to_surrender/) is on the front page of /r/The_Donald. And in that thread, on **three** separate occasions, /u/tehdono encouraged Trumpeters to brigade the thread, commenting once:

> Don't forget to click the other discussions tab!

And twice:
> PSA: When you see an article posted here, make sure you all hit the "other discussion" tab at the top **to add some balance cto /r/politics.**
isn't considered brigading either. Then you often don't have to wade through 1000 ctr propaganda submissions to find the good articles.

Edit: Unfortunately, /u/tehdono got scared after I called him out and deleted his comments. Luckily, you can still see them on his user page and in [this screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/ixGRN).

I wonder if the mods or admins will do anything? My money's on them ignoring it like they do always. What do you guys think?


EDIT: He's literally doing it again. Here's the /r/politics [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/540mx9/statement_on_hillary_clintons_death_tax_hypocrisy/), and here's the /r/The_Donald [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5404f7/statement_on_hillary_clintons_death_tax_hypocrisy/) on the front page of their cesspool where he's encouraging people to go brigade the /r/politics thread. Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/lggVB) for good measure. This is pitiful.

Atago is bae. I've got her fully decked out with a 18 point captain and that 21% fire chance is nothing to sneeze at.

But even with all of Atago's advantages, I can't seem to make up for shitty teammates - and this is at Rank 15 (or whatever it is when you first move to T8). DDs running off in random directions, CAs decided to just bumrush the entire enemy team, etc.

It seems like DDs really hold a lot of power in ranked, thanks to their torps (is this a wash, though, since Atago can stealth torp too?), concealment allowing them to cap, and smoke.

Is the Benson more capable of making up for bad teammates?

Apple's blamed Siri's shortcomings on microphones and that it's difficult to hear what you're saying. Personally, I don't buy that excuse since Google Now works *far* better on my iPhone than Siri does when using the same exact hardware, but whatever.

Hopefully they'll improve whatever microphone hardware they need to in order to bring Siri up to par. Now that she's on Macs and has gotten some machine learning skills (right?), it's the perfect time to improve Siri on iOS devices.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

I was doing alright for 10 days and then I checked the emails she'd sent me because I was having a bad day and I was missing her again. 

She was worried something had happened and if I was OK or not. I felt bad and didn't want to leave her hanging or wondering if I'd killed myself so I sent back a short reply just letting her know I was alive and well, that I just didn't want to talk. She replied back and said sorry and that she just wanted me to have a nice life and be happy -- basically saying goodbye all over again.

I feel so shitty. Powerless and shitty. I lost control over myself and over the situation. The whole point was to give us both space and to let her miss me but now she's got the upper hand. Maybe I'm just deluded. I'm not looking for revenge or to play mind games with her. I'm doing this so I can be a better person and so maybe we can have something again. 

I don't know anymore. It all seems pointless now. I feel like I should give up on NC and empty my heart out to her. Would that make things better? Is it hopeless now because I broke once already? </TEXT></SUBMISSION>

I can't tell if my mom was a narcissist or not. She's displayed some of the behaviours but it was never as bad as some of the things the users there describe. Maybe I just have a persecution complex or maybe I am a narcissist and don't realise it. They talk about narcissism as something so insidious, you'd never know you had it. It's confusing. 

Regardless, the userbase is fairly odd. I went through a couple of the top threads and most of them seemed vindictive -- reveling in sticking it to their narcissist parent/guardian/etc. Antagonising people just seems counterproductive, to me. Also, if it's as insidious a problem as they make it out to be when diagnosing themselves, the same benefit of the doubt should be afforded to others. 

I still have a lot more to discover so I might change my mind on this.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

My aunt is nuts (I don't know that she's been formally diagnosed with a mental illness, but it's highly likely - or a serious personality disorder)  She's in her late 60s.  She has a Law degree from an Ivy League school and a PhD in linguistics, but because she's fairly nutty, what she does for a living is teaching people who have failed the bar exam (the test you have to pass to be a lawyer) how to pass a specific section of the exam.  She's fairly right-wing in certain ways.  She lives by herself in a big city.  (Note the contradiction in those two preceding items.)  She's a fan of the Latin mass (the Catholic church switched to using the local language for masses in the early 60s).  She's a proponent of making contemporary buildings look "Classical", and strongly opposes proposals to build tall-ish buildings in the outer ring of Paris.

I am not conservative, and I'm an architect who doesn't think that we should make modern office buildings look like Roman temples.  When she brings up the terrifying proposition of tall buildings in Paris, I point out that there would be relatively few places in the center of the city where you can see over the existing buildings to see a 40 story building miles away, but that doesn't seem to satisfy her.  So, I tend to avoid any sort of in-depth conversations with her.

This isn't the end of the world if I can't come up with anything actually good for her.  My wife and I tend to give her gift baskets of gourmet foods - a set of high-quality teas, or a basket of chocolates and spices (we have no idea if she cooks.)  But it would be wonderful if any of this sparks the hive-mind to come up something nice that she might really appreciate and enjoy.</TEXT></SUBMISSION>

The blog title had both her name and her home phone number.  (It also turns out that this guy claims to have a very exclusive Somellier certification - so exclusive that no one can identify what organization awarded this title or find any record of this certification on the web that isn't linked to him personally.  Plus, he says he has a PhD in Economics from the Harvard School of Business, which is interesting both because no one can find him in any alum listings, no one can find his thesis and the Business School doesn't award PhDs in Economics.  Veddy interesting.)</TEXT></SUBMISSION>
