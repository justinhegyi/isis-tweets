The fact their comment sits there so long gets others to just brigade comments they don't like further down and continue to insult the OP of the comment further down the thread. I think its time you don't just remove the one uncivil comment, but remove the further ones in the thread that are usually much harsher. I also think if there is a user constantly making uncivil comments they should be banned. I've seen the same users saying stuff like 'go back to your safe space', name calling, etc. 20 times and yet they are still freely allowed to post and insult on this sub.
