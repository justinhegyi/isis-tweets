The fact their comment sits there so long gets others to just brigade comments they don't like further down and continue to insult the OP of the comment further down the thread. I think its time you don't just remove the one uncivil comment, but remove the further ones in the thread that are usually much harsher. I also think if there is a user constantly making uncivil comments they should be banned. I've seen the same users saying stuff like 'go back to your safe space', name calling, etc. 20 times and yet they are still freely allowed to post and insult on this sub. I know the Clinton/Kaine campaign is powered by insults but I don't think its appropriate and definitely doesn't lead to any productive conversation.</TEXT></COMMENT>

Well, if you have any personal thoughts or opinions about the state of this sub, I'd be interested to hear them.  If /u/pimanac essentially covered all of those already for you, that's fine too.  Just interested in hearing the perspectives from all the pro-Trump (or anti-Hillary) mods.

I don't have any other questions really, because I don't want to get into the whole discussion of trying to change the behavior of the users here and this subreddit.  That's an incredibly difficult (if not impossible) task, as /u/pimanac covered quite well.

>Unfortunately the echo chamber discourages anything beyond the hive mind opinion.

>Echo Chambers ARE a problem, no doubt.  But it's not something that is going to change on reddit any time soon, because of the way the site is designed - and I always remember that.

Very true.

>If you're discouraged by the echo chamber - remember you can get your political news from a variety of sources besides r//politics.  If someone ONLY get their political news from /r/politics then I question their objectivity.

I agree with this - and I do wonder sometimes how many people only get their political news from here.  I imagine it's a decent amount.  

>Hell, some are even decidedly neutral - CSPAN, for example, points a camera at a politician and when they're done talking the camera gets shut off.  No pundits to tell me how I should feel.  Unfortunately, that's not how the majority of Americans prefer to consume their political news - but that's another topic.

Agree 100%.  I wish more people preferred to consume their news like that, neutrally without any bias or spin, allowing them to shape their own opinions.

>I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I ever get discouraged by what I see on our front page, I remember that it's just reddit and that reddit is a poor measure of the political pulse of the nation at large.  If it were up to reddit, we'd have an outgoing President Ron Paul and an incoming President Bernie Sanders :-p

Then why the hell didn't you all stop him in your primary!?!?

I mean really, Trump is like an *Old God^TM* that you could have slain as it lay dormant. The party could have sauntered up, and stuck a sword in it before it was a threat **BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO** they **sat and watched** as devotees of the Old God^TM fed it sacrifice after sacrifice until it became too powerful to stop. 

Now that it is threatening to consume everything you care about in a orange feeding frenzy, "real conservatives" are upset about it? 

This is my huge fucking gripe with the republican party: This go around, you had a fascist among your political candidates and you did not stomp his political aspirations into the dirt. This man openly challenged the legitimacy of our elections by *telling his supporters to go monitor polls*. He is willing to undermine the results *by not acknowledging their legitimacy if he loses*. The ONLY saving grace is that he said these things after he got the nomination...and you are all damned again for not rebuking him for saying it.

This, in my view, is the inexcusable position. This is indefensible - how can a political candidate who is *supposed to be playing by the rules and running for office* then disparage the process should they lose?

> They feel like Trump hijacked their party

Hijacking implies taking by force. No. You all handed it to him. 

>but if Trump loses I imagine things will go back to normal after the party adjusts their guidelines to prevent someone like Trump from getting the nomination again.

When he loses, your party will never recover. Too many of you are too tied to this and - believe me - we will **not** let you pretend that this never happened. We wont let you forget that you chose this man over all of your legitimate candidates. We wont let you forget that this man got this far unopposed by the majority of your members. No. We will remind you because if we don't you will **too eagerly** pretend that it was - at worst - an aberration, an anomaly that was the responsibility of one man or a select few and **not** the result of years of anti-government policy, race baiting, and a low-information electorate.

Donald Trump is your candidate. Congratu-fucking-lations

I won't let you get away with weasel words. Who is "everyone" that knows? Also, thank you for backing your claim with a source, but you fail to mention that [the Heartland Institute is a conservative think thank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heartland_Institute) that is notoriously anti-science and pushes a number of positions held by its paid conservative donors. 

They are hardly impartial. 

>>I can't find any data that disproves this so if you can provide any data to back your point, I'll give this one to you.

>It's math.

Then provide a source! I won't allow you to make more assertions to back your assertions. The messed up part is that *I am prepared to concede this point.*

>Let's not forget, Obama also had a Democratic majority Congress during his first term in office. He had plenty of time to get things done but didn't.

You understand that a majority does not mean that the president can become a dictator, correct. Moreover, congress allocates the spending on any budget that the president proposes. 

The president is not a king.

>Check it for yourself

The nice thing about sources is that *I can check them* and you know what I see here? I see quotations that have been spun by a conservative writer on a conservative site for a conservative audience. Let's look at some of the more divisive comments!

>“I see people who mourn for the five officers we lost, but also weep for the families of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. In this audience, I see what’s possible.” 

Terrifying. I see such divisive rhetoric.

> “We also know that centuries of racial discrimination, of slavery, and subjugation, and Jim Crow; they didn’t simply vanish with the law against segregation…we know that bias remains. We know it, whether you are black, or white, or Hispanic, or Asian, or native American, or of Middle Eastern descent, we have all seen this bigotry in our own lives at some point. We’ve heard it at times in our own homes….No institution is entirely immune, and that includes our police departments. We know this.”

Talking about racism makes **him** the real racist! /s

>“if you’re black, you’re more likely to be pulled over or searched or arrested; more likely to get longer sentences; more likely to get the death penalty for the same crime.” 

He might as well just be calling for black riots, amirite?

>“When all this takes place, more than 50 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, we cannot simply turn away and dismiss those in peaceful protest as troublemakers or paranoid,” Obama said. “We can’t simply dismiss it as a symptom of political correctness or reverse racism. To have your experience denied like that, dismissed by those in authority, dismissed perhaps even by your white friends and coworkers and fellow church members, again and again and again, it hurts. Surely we can see that, all of us.” 

Because fuck blacks for peacefully protesting and being told their feelings are irrelevant. DIVIDER IN CHIEF AMIRITE?!?!

>“As a society, we choose to under-invest in decent schools. We allow poverty to fester so that entire neighborhoods offer no prospect for gainful employment.”

Fuck Obama for wanting to fund schools. That son of a bitch.

>“We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book.”

I don't know if this is factually correct, but you know what it isn't? Racially divisive unless you think guns are a race thing?

You ate up all those talking points hook line and sinker. 

>This subreddit is constantly using ad populum to attack Trump. Why is ad populum suddenly inaccurate now that Obama is the one people disagree with?

No harm, no foul. Onto your reply.

I don't disagree with your position. I think we do have some social dependency that we need to address but the republican party is not the solution. Right now, our system is able to be exploited and it isn't working as well as it could but the solution is not to burn it to the ground, which is what (historically) conservative administrations tend to do. They pretend that they are going to dismantle it and then rebuild it better, but what will really happen is that they will dismantle it and then...

...that's it. 

You could take the position that the left is playing on offering aid for votes, but I think (as you alluded to) it is more a reaction to the right's desire to burn away the entire social safety net. Even self sufficient left-thinking people like myself who don't use those programs and knows full well that some people exploit them are hesitant to vote republican because we know that there are a vast number of people who **do** use those programs properly.</TEXT></COMMENT>

You could start by telling me who and what argument they are presenting instead of dropping a weasel word.

I ask "argued by whom" because you saying "arguably" is a weasel word designed to indicate some sort of consensus without the work of actually demonstrating it. Moreover, if you are going to put forth someone else's argument (or even your own) I want to know exactly who I am arguing against so I don't accidentally strawman them.

>How old are you?

Old enough to both not get baited into a off the cuff response to condescension as well as old enough to know when someone uses terms like "welfare state" they had better define what they mean.

When you say "welfare state" you could be going for an exact definition or you could be going for a definition shaped by talking points. I have to ask because (if we are going to have a discussion) *definitions are important*.

>A welfare state: 

>a system whereby the government undertakes to protect the health and well-being of its citizens, especially those in financial or social need, by means of grants, pensions, and other benefits.


Good, a definition. You went through a lot of words to get here, like you were trying to rile me up or something. Now...why is this bad again? 

>We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, **promote the general Welfare**[emphasis mine], and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

I don't know what to say if you think "those institutions" only try to convert people who are there voluntarily. 

3. Even if people attend voluntarily, it's against basic ethical principles to engage in conversion therapy. It's unethical, harmful, discriminatory, oppressive, and ineffective. People who attend voluntarily often do so out of societal pressure and internalized homophobia. Conversion therapy elevates rates of depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicidal feelings. 

Trump supporters, can you stop thinking that LGBT folks don't deserve basic human rights? </TEXT></COMMENT>

Someone (Conway? Ivanka?) has said that Trump is an equal opportunity insulter, as if there were no harm in it.

Women covering the Trump Campaign might beg to differ:

>I join other women covering this election to say that I have twice had to seek out coping strategies for the misogyny and hate thrown at me on a daily basis by Trump supporters. Threatening a woman writer with rape should not be the normal response to a political article. This is a historical intimidation tactic used to silence women, and it’s still happening in many countries. It’s not exactly a part of “making America great again.”

Over time globalizing trade and moving manufacturing overseas and focusing on technical jobs here in the states will work, but only if all of the nations involved manage the transition fairly.

What he did specifically with the steel and aluminum was go to a nation that is artificially depressing the cost of those natural resources through government subsidies to extremely low levels.

And to help keep the pricing of American natural resources remotely competitive, the US has a tariff on those resources where you pay more than China is selling it or, and you pay that into the government.

Now, if he went through standard channels and made the purchases and paid the tariffs, that'd be much less of an issue. It would hurt American manufacturing right now when those workers are unable to transition, but it's a blip.

But he had companies make the purchases that were not America-based, so they paid no tariff, and then transferred the assets to his construction interests which *are* America-based, and essentially avoided paying the taxes.

It's a shady loophole, and it's one that he is, during this election, claiming he will close.

Essentially it boils down to (and this is a bit simplistic, but it fits):

> Hey, all of these things I am doing now that make me a smart businessman that you love me for are really just very horrible things that can ruin the country. But I am only doing these horrible things because the government lets me. 

> If you elect me President, I will totally close these loopholes that make me a ton of money. And ignore that I will want to probably keep those loopholes open since my companies will still be trying to make money like it is now.

On the taxes, it's that he has a long (like 4+ year) history on Twitter of tax shaming. He literally chided the Obama's for paying "only" 20.1% in 2012. He shit on Romney for not releasing his taxes until Sept21 of 2012, and the called him out for paying 15% or whatever it was. He decries that poor Americans pay no tax but take in government benefits that they need, and then he uses huge loopholes almost no one else can do do exactly the same thing, while being worth 10 figures.

For the steel and aluminum, he used off-shore shell holding companies to buy steel and aluminum from China to avoid paying the tariff on imported goods that he is now championing and promising to raise, all while talking about how he was going to bring back those bulk manufacturing jobs from China, too.

It's not the facts he *does it* that really irks people. It's the *hypocrisy* of doing it while telling voters that it's a horrible thing he will put a stop to.</TEXT></COMMENT>

The Chicago Tribune, for example, is clearly Republican - they almost always endorse Republicans.  But part of being professional journalists is that they try to be unbiased in their day-to-day news coverage.  Even in heavily Democratic Chicago, the Tribune is well respected for in-depth, accurate reporting.  But most papers at election time, offer an endorsement from the editorial board that is clearly set as an opinion separate from their normal news coverage.  The Tribune endorsed Johnson, which is very unusual for a bunch of Republicans.  USA Today ran an editorial rejecting Trump, but said that among the editorial board, they couldn't agree to endorse Clinton.

All of this is radically different than newspapers 100 years ago, where they were clearly totally biased in every way.</TEXT></COMMENT>

The same structure of political gains, fear and ignorance at play back then seemed to be at play today but with new targets and new lies.

It's insane that anyone today would still be thinking shit like that.  It's terrifying actually.</TEXT></COMMENT>
